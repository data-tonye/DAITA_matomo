## üåü Introduction

Matomo is an open-source web analytics platform that offers 100% data ownership, avoiding data privacy issues commonly associated with third-party analytics services like Google Analytics. This guide aims to provide a step-by-step tutorial for setting up Matomo on an Azure Virtual Machine (VM). 

## üõ† Prerequisites

- An Azure account
- SSH client (WSL for Windows, terminal for macOS and Linux)

## üöÄ Azure Virtual Machine Setup

### Step 1: Launch Azure Portal
- Open the Azure portal and sign in.
  
### Step 2: Create VM
- Navigate to "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
  
### Step 3: Configure VM
- Fill in the necessary details to configure your VM. Choose 'Linux' as the operating system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring the Virtual Machine

### Step 1: SSH into VM
- Open your SSH client and type:

```
ssh username@public_ip_address
```
Replace `username` and `public_ip_address` with your specific details.

### Step 2: Update and Install Packages
- Execute the following commands to update and install essential packages:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install php php-cli php-fpm php-curl php-gd mysql-server php-mysql php-xml php-mbstring unzip -y
```

## üì¶ Database Creation

### Step 1: Login to MySQL
- Login to MySQL as the root user.

```
sudo mysql -u root -p
```

### Step 2: Create Matomo Database and User
- Execute the following SQL commands:

```
CREATE DATABASE matomo;
CREATE USER 'matomo_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON matomo.* TO 'matomo_user'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

## üåê Installing and Configuring Nginx

### Step 1: Install Nginx
- To install Nginx, run:

```
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

### Step 2: Configure Nginx for Matomo
- Create a new Nginx configuration file for Matomo:

```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/matomo.conf
```

- Add the server configurations to this file. Make sure to replace server_name `example.com` with your specific domain name.
  
```
server {

  #listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
  #listen 443 ssl http2;
  listen [::]:80;
  listen 80;

  server_name example.com;
  root /var/www/matomo/;
  index index.php;

  location ~ ^/(index|matomo|piwik|js/index).php {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY ""; 
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock; 
  }

  location = /plugins/HeatmapSessionRecording/configs.php {
    include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
    fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
    fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
  }

  location ~* ^.+\.php$ {
    deny all;
    return 403;
  }

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
  }

  location ~ /(config|tmp|core|lang) {
    deny all;
    return 403;
  }

  location ~ \.(gif|ico|jpg|png|svg|js|css|htm|html|mp3|mp4|wav|ogg|avi|ttf|eot|woff|woff2|json)$ {
    allow all;
  }

  location ~ /(libs|vendor|plugins|misc/user) {
    deny all;
    return 403;
  }

}

```

### Step 3: Activate Configuration
- Link the file to `sites-enabled` and test the configuration:

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/matomo.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx.service
```

### If your nginx is not running
- Check the status of the nginx
```
sudo systemctl status nginx.service
```
- If it is not running, you have to kill the PID process for the port 80
  ```
  sudo lsof -i :80
  sudo kill <PID>
  ```
- Restart the nginx service
```
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx.service
sudo systemctl status nginx.service
```

## üìà Download and Extract Matomo

### Step 1: Create Web Server Directory
- Create and navigate to the web server directory:

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/ && cd /var/www/
```

### Step 2: Download and Extract Matomo
- Run these commands to download and extract Matomo:

```
wget https://builds.matomo.org/matomo.zip
unzip matomo.zip
rm matomo.zip
```

### Step 3: Change Ownership
- Change the ownership of the Matomo directory:

```
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/matomo
```

## üîí SSL Certificate Installation

### Step 1: Install Certbot
- Install the Certbot repositories and Certbot itself:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python-certbot-nginx -y
```

### Step 2: Generate SSL Certificate
- Generate the SSL certificate using Certbot:

```
sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain_name
```

- Now if we look at our /etc/nginx/sites-available/matomo.conf file we should see that certbot has added our SSL configurations for us.
  
## üéØ Completing Matomo Analytics Setup

- Open your web browser and go to your Matomo installation URL.
- Follow Matomo's on-screen instructions.

- Open your browser and navigate to the UVM WebDB phpMyAdmin URL.
- Login using your UVM WebDB credentials.

#### Step 2: Select the Database
- From the left sidebar, click on the database that you wish to export.

#### Step 3: Export the Database
- Click on the `Export` tab at the top.
- Choose the `Quick` method and the format as `SQL`, then click `Go`.
- Save the exported SQL file on your local machine.

### Importing Database to Azure VM

#### Step 1: SSH into Azure VM
- Open your SSH client and connect to your Azure VM:

```
ssh username@public_ip_address
```

#### Step 2: Install phpMyAdmin on Azure VM
- If phpMyAdmin is not already installed, install it using:

```
sudo apt install phpmyadmin
```

#### Step 3: Access phpMyAdmin on Azure VM
- Open your browser and navigate to your Azure VM phpMyAdmin URL.
- Log in using your Azure MySQL credentials.

#### Step 4: Create a New Database
- Create a new database that will receive the imported data:

```
CREATE DATABASE new_matomo_db;
```

#### Step 5: Import the Database
- Click on the new database you've created from the left sidebar.
- Click on the `Import` tab at the top.
- Choose the exported SQL file and click `Go`.

### Finalizing the Migration

#### Step 1: Update Matomo Configuration
- Open your Matomo `config.ini.php` file:

```
sudo nano /var/www/matomo/config/config.ini.php
```

- Update the database credentials to match those of the new Azure VM database.

#### Step 2: Clear Matomo Cache
- Clear the Matomo cache to apply changes:

```
cd /var/www/matomo/tmp/
sudo rm -rf cache/*
```

#### Step 3: Restart Services
- Restart MySQL and Nginx to ensure all changes take effect:

```
sudo systemctl restart mysql
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```
